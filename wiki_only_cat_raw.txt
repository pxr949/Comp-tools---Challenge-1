There are more than 70 cat [[breed]]s, though different associations proclaim different numbers according to their standards.

Cats are similar in [[Cat anatomy|anatomy]] to the other felids, with a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp retractable claws, and teeth adapted to killing small prey. [[Cat senses]] fit a [[crepuscular]] and [[predator]]y [[ecological niche]]. Cats can hear sounds too faint or too high in [[frequency]] for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small animals. They can see in near darkness. Like most other mammals, cats have poorer [[color vision]] and a better [[Olfaction|sense of smell]] than humans. Cats, despite being solitary hunters, are a [[social animal|social species]] and [[cat communication]] includes the use of a variety of [[Animal communication|vocalization]]s ([[Cat communication|mewing]], [[purr]]ing, [[Trill consonant|trilling]], hissing, [[growling]], and [[Guttural|grunting]]), as well as [[cat pheromone]]s and types of [[Cat body language|cat-specific body language]].<ref name="Moelk" />

[[Northern Sami language|Northern Sami]] ''gadfe'' "female stoat" and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] ''hölgy'' "stoat; lady, bride" from [[Proto-Uralic language|Proto-Uralic]] ''*kädwä'' "female (of a fur animal)".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kroonen|first1=Guus|title=Etymological Dictionary of Proto-Germanic|date=2013|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden|isbn=978-90-04-18340-7|pages=281f.}}</ref> In any case, ''cat'' is a classic case of a ''[[Wanderwort]]''.

An alternative word is English ''[[wikt:puss#English|puss]]'' (extended as ''pussy'' and ''pussycat'').

Similar forms exist in Lithuanian ''puiže'' and [[Irish language|Irish]] ''puisín'' or ''puiscín''.

A [[Pedigree (cat)|pedigreed cat]] is one whose ancestry is recorded by a [[Cat fancy|cat fancier]] organization. A [[purebred cat]] is one whose ancestry contains only individuals of the same breed. Many pedigreed and especially purebred cats are exhibited as [[show cat]]s. Cats of unrecorded, mixed ancestry are referred to as [[Domestic short-haired cat|domestic short-haired]] or [[domestic long-haired cat]]s, by [[Coat (animal)|coat]] type, or commonly as random-bred, moggies (chiefly [[British English|British]]), or (using terms borrowed from [[Dog breeds|dog breeding]]) mongrels or mutt-cats.

While the [[African wildcat]] is the ancestral subspecies from which domestic cats are descended, and wildcats and domestic cats can completely interbreed (being subspecies of the same species), several intermediate stages occur between domestic pet and pedigree cats on one hand and entirely wild animals on the other. The semiferal cat, a mostly outdoor cat, is not owned by any one individual, but is generally friendly to people and may be fed by several households. [[Feral cat]]s are associated with human habitation areas and may be fed by people or forage for food, but are typically wary of human interaction.<ref name="Bradshaw1999" />

This also provides sure footing for their hind paws when they navigate rough terrain. Unlike most mammals, when cats walk, they use a "pacing" [[gait]]; that is, they move the two legs on one side of the body before the legs on the other side. This trait is shared with [[camel]]s and [[giraffe]]s. As a walk speeds up into a trot, a cat's gait changes to be a "diagonal" gait, similar to that of most other mammals (and many other land animals, such as [[lizard]]s): the diagonally opposite hind and fore legs move simultaneously.<ref name="Christensen 2004">{{Cite book

To aid with navigation and sensation, cats have dozens of movable [[vibrissa|whiskers (vibrissae)]] over their body, especially their faces.

Most breeds of cat have a noted fondness for settling in high places, or perching. In the wild, a higher place may serve as a concealed site from which to hunt; domestic cats may strike prey by pouncing from a perch such as a tree branch, as does a [[leopard]].<ref name="Nash FS">{{cite web

Serious damage is rare, as the fights are usually short in duration, with the loser running away with little more than a few scratches to the face and ears. However, fights for mating rights are typically more severe and injuries may include deep puncture wounds and lacerations. Normally, serious injuries from fighting are limited to infections of scratches and bites, though these can occasionally kill cats if untreated.

Perhaps the best known element of cats' hunting behavior, which is commonly misunderstood and often appalls cat owners because it looks like torture, is that cats often appear to "play" with prey by releasing it after capture. This behavior is due to an instinctive imperative to ensure that the prey is weak enough to be killed without endangering the cat.<ref>{{cite web|title=Why do cats play with their food?|url=http://azdailysun.com/lifestyles/pets/article_46a97775-232d-5e56-b0ea-dd1c8782b062.html|publisher=Arizona Daily Sun|accessdate=15 August 2011}}</ref> This behavior is referred to in the [[idiom]] "cat-and-mouse game" or simply "[[cat and mouse]]".

Another poorly understood element of cat hunting behavior is the presentation of prey to human guardians. [[Ethology|Ethologist]] Paul Leyhausen proposed that cats adopt humans into their social group and share excess kill with others in the group according to the [[dominance hierarchy]], in which humans are reacted to as if they are at, or near, the top.<ref name="Leyhausen 1978">{{Cite book

[[File:Radiography of a pregnant cat.jpg|thumb|Radiography of a pregnant cat (about one month and a half)]]
Female cats are seasonally [[polyestrous]], which means they may have many periods of [[Estrus|heat]] over the course of a year, the season beginning in spring and ending in late autumn. Heat periods occur about every two weeks and last about 4 to 7 days.<ref name="compendium" /> Multiple males will be attracted to a female in heat. The males will fight over her, and the victor wins the right to mate. At first, the female rejects the male, but eventually the female allows the male to mate. The female utters a loud yowl as the male pulls out of her because a male cat's penis has a band of about 120–150 backwards-pointing [[penile spines]], which are about 1&nbsp;mm long; upon withdrawal of the penis, the spines rake the walls of the female's [[vagina]], which acts to [[Induced ovulation (animals)|induce ovulation]]. This act also occurs to clear the vagina of other sperm in the context of a second (or more) mating, thus giving the later males a larger chance of conception.<ref name="Aronson 1967">{{Cite journal

After mating, the female washes her [[vulva]] thoroughly. If a male attempts to mate with her at this point, the female will attack him. After about 20 to 30 minutes, once the female is finished grooming, the cycle will repeat.<ref name="compendium" />

[[Freyja]], the goddess of love, beauty, and fertility in [[Norse mythology]], is depicted as riding a chariot drawn by cats.<ref>{{cite book|last=Faulkes|first=Anthony|year=1995|title=Edda|page=24|ISBN=0-460-87616-3}}</ref>

==== Superstitions and cat burning ====
Many cultures have negative [[superstition]]s about cats. An example would be the belief that a [[black cat]] "crossing one's path" leads to bad luck, or that cats are witches' [[familiar spirit|familiar]]s used to augment a witch's powers and skills. The killing of cats in Medieval [[Ypres]], [[Belgium]], is commemorated in the innocuous present-day [[Kattenstoet]] (cat parade).<ref>{{cite web|title=Are Black Cats Really Bad Luck?

In medieval France, cats would be burnt alive as a form of entertainment. According to [[Norman Davies]], the assembled people "shrieked with laughter as the animals, howling with pain, were singed, roasted, and finally [[Carbonization|carbonized]]".<ref>{{cite book|last=Davies|first=Norman|title=Europe: a History|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=|isbn=0-198-20171-0|pages=543}}</ref>

"It was the custom to burn a basket, barrel, or sack full of live cats, which was hung from a tall mast in the midst of the bonfire; sometimes a [[fox]] was burned. The people collected the embers and ashes of the fire and took them home, believing that they brought good luck. The French kings often witnessed these spectacles and even lit the bonfire with their own hands. In 1648 [[Louis XIV]], crowned with a wreath of roses and carrying a bunch of roses in his hand, kindled the fire, danced at it and partook of the banquet afterwards in the town hall. But this was the last occasion when a monarch presided at the midsummer bonfire in Paris. At [[Metz]] midsummer fires were lighted with great pomp on the esplanade, and a dozen cats, enclosed in [[wicker]] cages, were burned alive in them, to the amusement of the people. Similarly at [[Gap, Hautes-Alpes|Gap]], in the [[Departments of France|department]] of the [[Hautes-Alpes]], cats used to be roasted over the midsummer bonfire."<ref>[[James Frazer|Frazer, Sir James George]].

According to a myth in many cultures, cats have multiple lives. In many countries, they are believed to have nine lives, but in Italy, Germany, Greece, Brazil and some Spanish-speaking regions, they are said to have seven lives,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://elcomercio.pe/impresa/notas/vidas-gato/20100307/423959 |date=7 March 2010 |accessdate=19 March 2010 |author=Nora Sugobono |language=Spanish |title=Las vidas del gato |publisher=El Comercio |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120127052854/http://elcomercio.pe/impresa/notas/vidas-gato/20100307/423959 |archivedate=27 January 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Qual é a origem da lenda de que os gatos teriam sete vidas?|url=http://mundoestranho.abril.com.br/materia/qual-e-a-origem-da-lenda-de-que-os-gatos-teriam-sete-vidas|website=[[Mundo Estranho]]|publisher=[[Editora Abril]]|accessdate=15 November 2015}}</ref> while in Turkish and Arabic traditions, the number of lives is six.<ref>{{Cite news|work=The Guardian |location=UK |url= https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/gallery/2010/mar/18/guide-to-pets-pet-myths?picture=360591960|accessdate=18 March 2010|author=Tim Dowling|title=Tall tails: Pet myths busted|date=19 March 2010}}</ref> The myth is attributed to the natural suppleness and swiftness cats exhibit to escape life-threatening situations. Also lending credence to this myth is the fact that falling cats often land on their feet, using an instinctive [[cat righting reflex|righting reflex]] to twist their bodies around. Nonetheless, cats can still be injured or killed by a high fall.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cats.about.com/od/catsafety/a/highrisefalls.htm|title=The ASPCA Warns About High-Rise Falls by Cats|author=ASPCA|date=30 June 2005|publisher=About.com|accessdate=26 April 2012|location=New York}}</ref>
